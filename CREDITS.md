# Thank you

This file acknowledges the work of the great Internet users who helped me for this project.  

Thanks to their contribution for the open-source world, I was able to do this project without much hassle.
(By the way, it is just a fair return to publish my work with the same license).

So thank you to:
- **[Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/)** for their librairies and their explanations really really complete. 
- **[Sodaq](https://github.com/SodaqMoja/)** for the libraries
- **[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)** for the idea of making cheap programming cards and giving source code in the public domain (plus the examples files which offer a really good base). You inspired so many makers!
- _More to come_
